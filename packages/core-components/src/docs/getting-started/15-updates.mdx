# Updates

<br />

## B2B DESIGN SYSTEM going open source & released our first stable release!

We are happy to announce that we have migrated our system and packages successfully.
From now on, you would be able to install our libraries directly from npm without the need for authentication.

You can find our new open source repo in [this link](https://github.com/otto-de/b2b-design-system).

<br />

### For teams using the components for the first time

You don't have to do anything special, just go ahead and install the library that fits your project:

[b2b-core-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@otto-de/b2b-core-components) - Core web components, can be used with Vue.

[b2b-react-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@otto-de/b2b-react-components) - React wrapper library, exposes first class React components. Wrapper is created by Stencil.

[b2b-tokens](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@otto-de/b2b-tokens) - These are atomic design decisions that can be used to
centrally change the styles of our components. For more information about Design Tokens read [here](https://specifyapp.com/blog/introduction-to-design-tokens).

### For teams that are using our private packages

You will have to update the dependency organisation, now it will be `otto-de`, and change to the latest stable version.

If you were using the `.npmrc` file and had configured a GitHub PAT token for installation, you can remove it only if
you are not using other otto internal packages. Otherwise, that should not cause issues in downloading the open
source library.

☝️ You may also need to change the organisation name wherever you were importing the components or library resources
to `otto-de`.

☝️ Please do update to this new library as the private package is not going to be updated nor maintained from now on.
