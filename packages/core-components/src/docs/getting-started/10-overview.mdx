# B2B DESIGN SYSTEM

The goal of the [B2B Design System](https://github.com/otto-de/b2b-design-system) is to provide frontend components that encapsulate styles and behaviour for teams
to use ideally out of the box.

<br />

## Web Components

We value highly independent teams, which is why we support multiple JavaScript frameworks with our
solution. [Web
Components](https://www.webcomponents.org/) are a set of native features that provide a model for encapsulation of
individual HTML elements that is [already highly compatible](https://custom-elements-everywhere.com/) with Javascript Frameworks.

<br />

## What is a pattern?

Patterns are recurring building blocks and components in the frontend that are provided centrally with the goal of
ensuring visual and functional consistency. Patterns can be provided at different levels: local patterns
are developed by an OPC module team â€“ global patterns are developed by the B2B-Neptune team and made available to all
OPC module teams.

<br />

## Framework Compatibility

Currently, we support Vue 2, 3 and React.

If you would like to start right away, choose your framework and follow the guides.
