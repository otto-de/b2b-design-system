# Package Installation

## npm

Visit [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40otto-de) and install our core components directly by running for example:

```
npm i @otto-de/b2b-core-components @otto-de/b2b-tokens
```

To use the components, you need to load a CSS file and some JavaScript. The CSS file includes the fonts and the design tokens. In this case, there is no need to install the tokens package again.

## Plain HTML

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://internal.otto.market/design-system/dist/b2b-core-components/b2b-core-components.css" />
<script
  type="module"
  src="https://internal.otto.market/design-system/dist/b2b-core-components/b2b-core-components.esm.js"></script>
```

## With a bundler or ES modules

```js
import '~@otto-de/b2b-core-components/dist/b2b-core-components/b2b-core-components.css';
```

## GitHub Packages

The B2B Design System provides its npm packages through GitHub packages under the @otto-de organisation.

GitHub packages requires an authentication token to be present in your local environment and pipelines
to be able to install the package.

In this guide you can find:

- [Configure token for local development](#configure-token-for-local-development)
- [Configure token for CI](#configure-token-for-local-development)
- [Generate Personal Access Token](#generate-personal-access-token-pat)
- [External links](#for-more-information-you-can-read)

<br />

## Configure token for local development

For local development you can log in to npm on the command line or generate a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)
from your GitHub account following [these steps](#generate-personal-access-token-pat).

We recommend adding the token as an env variable in your system:

```
export GITHUB_TOKEN=<TOKEN>
```

Once you have a token, you can configure access in two ways:

option 1: Add the token to your per-user `~/.npmrc` file.

option 2: Create an `.npmrc` file in the root of the project.

In both cases, include the following lines:

```
@otto-ec:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=${GITHUB_TOKEN}
```

This is in detailed explained in [Authenticating to GitHub Packages guide](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-npm-registry#authenticating-to-github-packages)

<br />

## Configure token for CI

These steps are needed both if using GitHub actions or other ci environments.

To authenticate with GitHub packages you will need to use a PAT (Personal Access Token). For ci usage it is
recommended to use a Functional User token. If your team hasn't created a `GitHub Technical Functional User (FKT)`
yet, you can follow [this guide](https://confluence.otto.de/x/P4aTFg) to do so.

If you already have a `FKT` for your team, you can follow the [these steps](#generate-personal-access-token-pat) for
the technical user and get the token to be used in the env variables in your ci.

Create an `.npmrc` file in the root of the project, if you haven't done so yet.

```
@otto-ec:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=${GITHUB_TOKEN}
```

### Using GitHub Actions

To configure GitHub actions, you can add the token as a secret env variable, and add it to your npm install step in
your workflow file, for example:

```
- name: Install dependencies
  run: npm ci
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{secrets.TEAM_PACKAGE_TOKEN}}
```

## Generate Personal Access Token (PAT)

**1.** Go to your _GitHub profile > settings > developer settings_.

Under _Personal access tokens_, create a new token and name it according to your needs. Select `read:packages`
scope and hit `generate token`.

_Be sure to copy the token and save it somewhere only accessible to you as you won't see it again._

If you want to use an existing token, just add the permissions: `read:packages`

**2.** Select `configure SSO` and authorize Otto organization. Follow the steps displayed.
