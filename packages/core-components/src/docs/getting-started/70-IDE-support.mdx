## React

React autocomplete works with the use of Typescript annotations and JSDocs. It works out of the box in VSCode even

not using Typescript.

## Vue

For Vue autocomplete and documentation to fully work in your IDE, please follow up these configurations:

### VSCode

If you haven't done so already, create a `.vscode` directory and a `settings.json` file. Add the following
settings after you have installed the B2B Component Library:

```json
{
  "html.customData": [
    "./node_modules/@otto-de/b2b-core-components/dist/custom-elements.json"
  ]
}
```

### JetBrains (IntelliJ, WebStorm)

Add the following line to your package.json.

```json
  "web-types": "./node_modules/@otto-de/b2b-core-components/dist/web-types.json"
```
