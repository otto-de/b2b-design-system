# Input Group Component

<Canvas columns={3} withSource="open" withToolbar={false}>
  <Story id="components-form-input-group--story-010-default" />
</Canvas>

The Input Group Component provides a visual wrapper to concatenate several form components together.

**_ Important _** You can only use B2B Form Components inside of this wrapper, such as
B2B Dropdowns, B2B Inputs or B2B Buttons. Other components such as B2B Textarea or non-B2B Components will not look good.

## Slots

The Input Group consists of multiple individual B2B Form Components. They are visually grouped together.
Like other Form Group Components, such as Radio or Checkbox Group, they have a group error and a group hint,
as well as a group-wide disabled state. The first and the last element in the group need to be placed in their
respective slots.

### Start

This is the first element in the input group. It will have rounded corners on the left-hand side.

```html
<b2b-input slot="start" label="Search Term"></b2b-input>
```

### End

This is the last element in the input group. It will have rounded corners on the right-hand side.

```html
<b2b-button slot="end" variant="primary"
  ><b2b-icon icon="b2b_icon-search"></b2b-icon
></b2b-button>
```

### Default

All other content does not require a named slot and can be placed anywhere in the wrapper.
Please note that a complex Input Group with three or more elements will rarely be used.

<Canvas columns={3} withSource="open" withToolbar={false}>
  <Story id="components-form-input-group--story-040-complex" />
</Canvas>

You can set labels on individual components as usual to indicate what the individual input field is for.

## Properties

### Hint

A group hint text. This should indicate what the Input Group is about.

Do note that the Input Group removes all individual hints from its children.

### Error

A group error message. It is recommended to specify this whenever you plan to validate input.
It will only be shown when invalid is set to `true`.

Do note that the Input Group removes all individual error messages from its children.

### Invalid

If set to true, all components inside of the Input Group will be rendered with error styles
and an error message will be shown if specified.

### Disabled

If set to true, all components inside of the Input Group will be disabled and an error message
will not be shown, even if the group is also marked as invalid.
