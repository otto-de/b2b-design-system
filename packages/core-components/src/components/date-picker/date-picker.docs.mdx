# DatePicker Component

<Canvas of={DatePickerStories.Default} />

The B2B date picker component is interactive and provides option to select a particular date, by selecting a day, a month and a year.
You can hook into an event that fires whenever the user selects a date from the date picker.

☝️ You should not add other interactive content such as links or buttons to the date picker.

☝️ Remember not to use the date picker just to display the dates, it is an interactive element and must execute an action when
clicked

NOTE: DisablePastDates, DisableFutureDates, DisableWeekends are optional. The component can simply be used like this without specifying any properties aside from the label:

<Source code={`<b2b-date-picker></b2b-date-picker>`} />

## Properties

### DisablePastDates

All the dates that are previous to the today's date of the date picker can be disabled, and those dates would render opaque and unclickable.

<Canvas of={DatePickerStories.DisablePastDates} />

### DisableFutureDates

All the dates that are future to the today's date of the date picker can be disabled, and those dates would render opaque and unclickable.

<Canvas of={DatePickerStories.DisableFutureDates} />
