# DatePicker Component

<Canvas of={DatePickerStories.Default} />

The B2B date picker component is interactive and provides option to select a particular date, by selecting a day, a month and a year.
You can hook into an event that fires whenever the user selects a date from the date picker.

☝️ You should not add other interactive content such as links or buttons to the date picker.

☝️ Remember not to use the date picker just to display the dates, it is an interactive element and must execute an action when
clicked

NOTE: DisablePastDates, DisableFutureDates, DisableWeekends are optional. The component can simply be used like this without specifying any properties aside from the label:

<Source code={`<b2b-date-picker></b2b-date-picker>`} />

## Properties

### DisablePastDates

All the dates that are previous to the today's date of the date picker can be disabled, and those dates would render opaque and unclickable.

<Canvas of={DatePickerStories.DisablePastDates} />

### DisableFutureDates

All the dates that are future to the today's date of the date picker can be disabled, and those dates would render opaque and unclickable.

<Canvas of={DatePickerStories.DisableFutureDates} />

### DisableWeekends

All the dates that are weekends can be disabled, and those dates would render opaque and unclickable.

<Canvas of={DatePickerStories.DisableWeekends} />

### preSelectedDate

Default selected date can be provided in this format dd.mm.yyyy

<Canvas of={DatePickerStories.preSelectedDate} />

### showHint

Unlike other components teams will not be able to edit the hint message of the component, however you can choose to show or hide the hint message using this property. By default, this will be true.
