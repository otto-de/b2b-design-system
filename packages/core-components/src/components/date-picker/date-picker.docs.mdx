# DatePicker Component

<Canvas of={DatePickerStories.Default} />

The B2B date picker component is interactive and provides option to select a particular date, by selecting a day, a month and a year.
You can hook into an event that fires whenever the user selects a date from the date picker.

☝️ You should not add other interactive content such as links or buttons to the date picker.

☝️ Remember not to use the date picker just to display the dates, it is an interactive element and must execute an action when
clicked
