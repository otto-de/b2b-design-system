# Card Component

<Canvas columns={3} withSource="open" withToolbar={false}>
  <Story id="components-interaction-card--story-010-card" />
</Canvas>

The B2B card component is interactive and used to group content into one interaction. You can hook into an event
that fires whenever the user selects a card or pass a `href` property to create a redirect.

☝️ You should not add other interactive content such as links or buttons to the card.

☝️ Remember not to use the card just to display content, it is an interactive element and must execute an action when
clicked

NOTE: All attributes are optional. The component can simply be used like this without specifying any attributes:

<Source code={`<b2b-card>My Card</b2b-card>`} />

## Properties

### Disabled

The card can be disabled and it would render opaque and unhoverable. It cannot be navigated to via keyboard.

<Canvas withSource="close" withToolbar={false}>
  <Story id="components-interaction-card--story-020-disabled-card" />
</Canvas>

### href

If you want to use a redirect with the card, you can pass a url to the `href` property.

<Canvas withSource="close" withToolbar={false}>
  <Story id="components-interaction-card--story-030-link-card" />
</Canvas>

### Target

If the card is passed an `href` prop, the `target` prop can be used in the same way as an anchor tag to define if the redirect will happen
in the same or a new tab.

## Events

### b2b-selected

This event emits whenver the user selects the card by clicking on it or pressing enter while it has focus. You can listen to this
event if you want to trigger an action on select. If you have several cards, you can assign them ids and use the `event.target` to determine which card
was clicked.
