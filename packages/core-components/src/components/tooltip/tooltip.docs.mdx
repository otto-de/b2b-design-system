# Tooltip Component

<Canvas columns={3} withSource="open" withToolbar={false}>
  <Story id="components-interaction-tooltip--story-010-hover" />
</Canvas>

## Properties

### Position

The tooltip can be positioned relative to it's trigger element. Per default,
it will be positioned on top of the trigger element. Other options are

- Bottom
- Left
- Right

It is advisable to position it so that the element will not be cut off by window
bounds. Additionally, when wrapping a block-level element like a `<div>`, the tooltip
will be positioned relative to the whole line. If you want a left or right aligned tooltip
with a block-level element, please set it to `display: inline-block` to make sure it only uses
the space it needs:

<Canvas columns={3} withSource="open" withToolbar={false}>
  <Story id="components-interaction-tooltip--story-090-block-element" />
</Canvas>

Additionally, the tooltip will try to fit it's content up to a maximum width
of `20rem` or `320px`, then it will overflow to the next line.

### Trigger

The tooltip can be triggered by three different events:

- hover
- focus
- custom event

Per default, it will be triggered by hovering over the trigger element inside of the tooltip.

When adding a focusable element inside the tooltip like an anchor or a button and setting the trigger
to `focus`, the tooltip will appear whenever the element is focused, i.e. by tabbing to or pressing the button.

If the tooltip needs to be triggered programmatically by a custom event, it is possible to use the tooltip's public methods described
below.

### Content

The content of the tooltip that will be displayed inside of it. It can be either text or custom content like an anchor.
If you need text only, you can use the `content` property on the element directly. If you need custom content, use the slot
called `content`.

```html
<b2b-tooltip><b2b-icon slot="content"></b2b-icon></b2b-tooltip>
```
