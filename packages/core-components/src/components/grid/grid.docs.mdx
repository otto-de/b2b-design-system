# Grid Component

<Canvas columns={3} withSource="closed" withToolbar={false}>
  <Story id="components-utilities-grid--story-030-text-align"></Story>
</Canvas>

You can use the grid component to help in crafting layouts following design briefings that use grids.
This grid is not responsive, so when using it in containers of limited sizes, try to use less columns so that they
won't wrap because there won't be enough space.

### Grid Properties

#### Margin

The overall margin of the grid, i.e. the padding the grid will have towards surrounding elements.
If not specified, it defaults to 24px. Since it is of type number, you do not need to supply the `px` at the end.

  format={false}
  code={dedent`<b2b-grid margin="24"></b2b-grid>`}></Source>

# Grid Row

A grid consists of at least one row that can hold an indefinite amount of columns.
The maximum number of columns that are displayed in the same row is 12 for single-span columns.
Columns with a `span` greater than one count towards the maximum equal to their `span` width.
All additional columns will overflow to the next line.

### Row Properties

#### Column Gap

The gap between each column of a given row. Per default it is 24px wide. You do not need to supply the `px` at the end.
Please note that if you're writing vanilla HTML, you need to use kebap-case instead of the original camelCase.

<Source
  language="tsx"
  format={false}
  code={dedent`<b2b-grid margin="24">
        <b2b-grid-row column-gap="24"></b2b-grid-row>
    </b2b-grid>`}></Source>

#### Row Gap

The gap between a given row and the previouss / next row. Per default it is 24px wide. You do not need to supply the `px` at the end.
Please note that if you're writing vanilla HTML, you need to use kebap-case instead of the original camelCase.

<Source
  language="tsx"
  format={false}
  code={dedent`<b2b-grid margin="24">
        <b2b-grid-row row-gap="24"></b2b-grid-row>
    </b2b-grid>`}></Source>

#### Align Items

Vertical alignment of columns within a given row. Use it if you have column content that has different heights.
Please note that this only works if the content blocks have a set height or some content that determines their height.
If the height is not set, per default the items will stretch to be the same height.

<Source
  language="tsx"
  format={false}
  code={dedent`<b2b-grid margin="24">
        <b2b-grid-row align-items="center"></b2b-grid-row>
    </b2b-grid>`}></Source>

#### Justify

The justification of columns within a given row similar to flexbox horizontal content distribution.
If you have less than 12 columns (or the sum of spans for columns with a width greater than 1 span is less than 12),
setting the `justify` property will align your columns horizontally. Per default all columns are aligned left-to-right or `start`.

<Source
  language="tsx"
  format={false}
  code={dedent`<b2b-grid margin="24">
        <b2b-grid-row justify="start"></b2b-grid-row>
    </b2b-grid>`}></Source>

# Grid Column

A maximum of 12 individual columns can be used inside one row. They hold the content of the grid system.

### Column Properties

#### Span

The width of the column by amount of individual columns and gaps it is supposed to span, up to 12 columns for just one large column.
For example, two columns each with a `span="6"` will create a row with two large columns.
Per default and if not otherwise specified, a column will take up all space available in a row.
If you put multiple columns in a row that don't have a specified span, they will all be equal width.

<Source
  language="tsx"
  format={false}
  code={dedent`<b2b-grid margin="24">
        <b2b-grid-row>
            <b2b-grid-col span="6"></b2b-grid-col>
            <b2b-grid-col span="6"></b2b-grid-col>
        </b2b-grid-row>
    </b2b-grid>`}></Source>

#### Text Align

If there is any text content inside the column, the `text-align` property determines it's orientation. Per default all text is left-aligned.

<Source
  language="tsx"
  format={false}
  code={dedent`<b2b-grid margin="24">
        <b2b-grid-row>
            <b2b-grid-col text-align="left"></b2b-grid-col>
        </b2b-grid-row>
    </b2b-grid>`}></Source>
