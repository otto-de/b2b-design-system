# Breadcrumb Component

The Breadcrumb Component is used to display a breadcrumb trail for the user to navigate through the application. It is used in conjunction with the Breadcrumb Item Component.

# Breadcrumb Item

## Properties

### href

The b2b-breadcrumb-item has an optional href attribute that can be used to make the breadcrumb item a link. If the href attribute is not specified, the breadcrumb item will be a span.
The link provided will open in the same page, similar to `target="self"`.

### active

Whether the item is currently active. This state must be controlled by consumers. When an item is active, it cannot be hovered and no selection
event is emitted in order to prevent navigating in place.

### paddingVertical

The `paddingVertical` property allows you to adjust the vertical padding (top and bottom) of the `Breadcrumb` component. This property accepts pixel values as a number.

| Property          | Type     | Default | Description                                            |
| ----------------- | -------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `paddingVertical` | `number` | `0`     | Sets the vertical padding of the breadcrumb component. |

## Events

### b2b-selected

This fires when an item is clicked on or navigated to via keyboard. It does not fire when an href property is specified as the browser
takes care of navigation.

<ArgsTable story={PRIMARY_STORY} />
