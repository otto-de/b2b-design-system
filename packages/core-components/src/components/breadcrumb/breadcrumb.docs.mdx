# Breadcrumb Item

## Properties

### href

The b2b-breadcrumb-item has an optional href attribute that can be used to make the breadcrumb item a link. If the href attribute is not specified, the breadcrumb item will be a span.
The link provided will open in the same page, similar to `target="self"`.

### active

Whether the item is currently active. This state must be controlled by consumers. When an item is active, it cannot be hovered and no selection
event is emitted in order to prevent navigating in place.

### paddingTop & paddingBottom

The `paddingTop` and `paddingBottom` properties allow you to adjust the top and bottom padding of the `Breadcrumb` component respectively. These properties accept pixel values as numbers.

| Property        | Type     | Default | Description                                |
| --------------- | -------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `paddingTop`    | `number` | `0`     | Sets the top padding of the breadcrumb.    |
| `paddingBottom` | `number` | `0`     | Sets the bottom padding of the breadcrumb. |

## Events

### b2b-selected

This fires when an item is clicked on or navigated to via keyboard. It does not fire when an href property is specified as the browser
takes care of navigation.
