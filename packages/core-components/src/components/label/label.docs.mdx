# Label

The label can be used to display information about an object, such as the status or category of an object.
The label contains only a single word to describe the status of an object. Multiple words are used only when a complex condition needs to be described. The status is described in the past tense. For example "Requested" instead of "Request".

## Properties

### Type

**_Default:_** For uncritical status updates that need not be very noticeable.

<Story of={LabelStories.story010Neutral} />

**_Error:_** For critical issues that require the user's attention and possible actions. This label variant should be
used sparingly.

<Story of={LabelStories.story050Error} />

**_Warning:_** For topics that require the user's attention but the issue is not critical.

<Story of={LabelStories.story040Warning} />

**_Info:_** For attributes with an informative character, such as "Inquired" for a service or "Submitted" for a briefing.

<Story of={LabelStories.story020Info} />

**_Success:_** For successful or completed status if it is important for the user to achieve it. For example, if the user has successfully set up a brand shop briefing, it will be marked "Completed". For closed states that are not that important, a neutral label can also be used. For example, "Completed" on a service booking. The success label can also be used for the active state of objects. For example, a service that can be either "Active" or "Inactive".
