## Properties

### Description

This is where you can define the text that will be shown in snackbar.

### Type

**_Info:_** Use for providing neutral, informative messages that donâ€™t require immediate action, such as general information.

**_Error:_** Use to notify the user about a problem or failure, such as an invalid action or error that requires attention or correction.

**_Warning:_** Use to alert the user about a potential issue or cautionary message, usually to warn about possible consequences of a user action.

**_Success:_** Use to confirm that an action was completed successfully, such as a successful submission, upload, or other positive feedback.

### Timed

This property allows you to set the snackbar to be auto hidden after certain amount of time. By default, it is false.
Please note, that snackbars of type `error` cannot be timed.

### Duration

If you set `timed` as true, using this property you can define the interval after which the snackbar will be hidden. Default is 5000ms.

_Note_: when user hovers over the snackbar, timeout is paused and resumes once the mouse leaves.

### Width

This property allow you to set the snackbar width. Default value is auto, which will adjust the width to fit the content.

### Action

If you want your snackbar to have an action button, set `hasAction` to true. By default, it is false.

#### Action Label

Provide a description of what your action will do using `actionLabel` property.

#### On Action Click

If you have set `hasAction` as true, when the user clicks on the Call-to-action, the `b2b-action-click` event will be emitted.
By listening to it, you can perform a particular action. See the example below:

```jsx
<B2bSnackbar
  type="error"
  has-action="true"
  onB2b-action-click={onActionClicked()}></B2bSnackbar>
```
