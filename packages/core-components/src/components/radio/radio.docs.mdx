# Singular Radio Button

### Properties

<Canvas columns={3} withSource="open" withToolbar={false}>
  <Story id="components-form-radio-button--story-010-default" />
</Canvas>

#### Label

The label of the radio button which appears on the right hand side next to it. This is a
required property. It is not the same as the radio button value, which indicates its programmatical
value.

#### Required

Adds an asterisk at the end of the label to signify that the field is required. This would not perform any
validation, is just a style addition.

#### Checked

Whether or not the radio button is currently checked. It is initially unchecked if the property is not specified.

#### Disabled

Whether or not the radio button is disabled. If not specified, it will not be disabled.

#### Invalid

Whether or not the radio button is invalid. The default value is false and setting it to true will render the
radio button with an error style.

#### Hint

A hint text that shows additional information to the user. Per default it is undefined.

#### Error

An error hint text that is displayed instead of the hint text if the `invalid` property is set to true.
Setting the error string alone is not sufficient to display an error, the `invalid` property also needs to be `true`.
We recommend always setting the error string if there is a possibility that the radio button will become `invalid`.

#### Name

This is used to programmatically group radio buttons together. It is required to control the state of a radio button group.
This is especially important for accessibility as the name groups label and radio button together, making them easier to navigate for screen readers.

#### Value

The radio button value. It does not have to be the same as the radio button label. When the radio button is checked,
the value gets emitted alongside the radio button's current status.

### Events

#### b2b-focus

Fires whenever the radio button comes into focus.

#### b2b-blur

Fires whenever the radio button loses focus.

#### b2b-change

Fires whenever the `checked` property of the radio button component changes. Emits a custom event
called `RadioEventDetail` that contains the value of the radio button and whether or not the
radio button is currently checked.

`RadioEventDetail<T = any> {
  value: T;
  checked: boolean;
}`
