## Properties

### Label

The label for the whole checkbox group. This field is recommended, but not required as it can
be ignored in some use cases. For example, when the solution needs a label with a description block of text after it.

Internally the component sets the aria property `aria-labelledby` to the `name` prop of this component. When using a
custom label, remember to set that same name to the `id` of the label. For more information you can see [this link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-labelledby).

### Required

Adds an asterisk at the end of the label to signify that the field is required. This would not perform any
validation, is just a style addition.

### Disabled

Whether or not the Checkbox Group as a whole is disabled. If not specified, it is set to false.
If both `disabled` and `invalid` properties are set to true, `disabled` will take precedence and no
error will be shown or error styles rendered.

### Invalid

Whether or not the Checkbox Group is rendered with error styles. Setting this will also render an
error text if it is specified. The `disabled` property takes precedence over `invalid` regarding styling.

### Hint

A hint text that refers to all checkboxes in the checkbox group.
Using a checkbox component in a group will set all individual hint texts to be undefined.

### Error

An error text for the Checkbox Group. It will be rendered instead of the hint text if it is specified.
If no error text is specified, but the Checkbox Group is set to `invalid`, the hint text will
not appear. The string will be set to undefined for the individual checkbox component if it is used in a group.

## Events

### b2b-group-change

Fires whenever the `checked` property of one of its checkbox children is changed.
Emits a custom event called `CheckboxEventDetail` that contains the value of the checkbox
as well as it's current status.

`CheckboxEventDetail<T = any> {
  value: T;
  checked: boolean;
}`
