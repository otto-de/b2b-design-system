## Properties

### Label

The label of the checkbox which appears on the right hand side next to it. This is the only
required property. It is not the same as the checkbox value, which indicates its programmatical
value. If you need custom content like bold text or a link, use the named slot label.

### Required

Adds an asterisk at the end of the label to signify that the field is required. This would not perform any
validation, is just a style addition.

### Checked

Whether or not the checkbox is currently checked. It is initially unchecked if the property is not specified.

### Disabled

Whether or not the checkbox is disabled. If not specified, it will not be disabled.

### Invalid

Whether or not the checkbox is invalid. The default value is false and setting it to true will render the
checkbox with an error style.

### Hint

A hint text that shows additional information to the user. Per default it is undefined.

### Error

An error hint text that is displayed instead of the hint text if the `invalid` property is set to true.
Setting the error string alone is not sufficient to display an error, the `invalid` property also needs to be `true`.
We recommend always setting the error string if there is a possibility that the checkbox will become `invalid`.

### Name

This can be used to programmatically group checkboxes together. This is especially important for accessibility
as the name groups label and checkbox together, making them easier to navigate for screen readers.

### Value

The checkbox value. It does not have to be the same as the checkbox label. When the checkbox is checked or unchecked,
the value gets emitted alongside the checkboxes current status.

## Events

### b2b-focus

Fires whenever the checkbox comes into focus.

### b2b-blur

Fires whenever the checkbox loses focus.

### b2b-change

Fires whenever the `checked` property of the checkbox component changes. Emits a custom event
called `CheckboxEventDetail` that contains the value of the checkbox and whether or not the
checkbox is currently checked.

`CheckboxEventDetail<T = any> {
  value: T;
  checked: boolean;
}`

## Slots

### Label

If you need the label to contain something other than plain text you may use the label slot like so:

<Canvas of={CheckboxStories.story070LabelSlot} sourceState="shown" />
