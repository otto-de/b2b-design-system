# Alert Component

The alert allows the user to see contextual feedback and information.
There are the following alert variants:

### Type

**_Info:_** For attributes with an informative character, such as "Inquired" for a service or "Submitted" for a briefing.

<b2b-alert opened size="large" type="info">An info alert.</b2b-alert>

**_Error:_** For critical issues that require the user's attention and possible actions. This alert type should be
used sparingly.

<b2b-alert opened size="large" type="error">An error alert.</b2b-alert>

**_Warning:_** For topics that require the user's attention but the issue is not critical.

<b2b-alert opened size="large" type="warning">A warning alert.</b2b-alert>

**_Success:_** For successful or completed status if it is important for the user to achieve it.

<b2b-alert opened size="large" type="success">A success alert.</b2b-alert>

**_There is the possibility of including a "closing-X" in the alert, by which the message can be hidden. The "closing-X" cannot be used for error alerts._**

## Properties

### Size

The Alert Component comes in two sizes. The default is `small`, which renders only an icon and no text. Any slotted text will not be displayed. The close icon will also not be shown on the small alert.
The large Alert Component comes with customizable text and an optional close icon. Please note that the first word or sentence of the alert is normally bold, but can be customized as well.

### Close Button

Per default, all large alerts except the error alert have a close button. By setting `hasCloseButton` to false, you can remove it.

### Custom Icon

A small Alert Component can also have a custom icon. If you're using B2B or PaLi icons, they will be displayed in the same color as the large alert icons
that come with the different alert types.

## Events

### b2b-close

Fires whenever the close button is clicked.
