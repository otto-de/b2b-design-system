# Rounded Icon Component

The rounded icon is meant to contain either any b2b-icon or a text that must be one character long.

### Icon content

To display an icon as content, use the `slot='icon'` as an attribute of `b2b-icon` as you can see in this example:

<Canvas columns={3} withSource="open" withToolbar={false}>
  <Story id="components-assets-rounded-icon--story-010-icon" />
</Canvas>

### Text content

For text content please use a single character if you use text If you need to display more text maybe the [Label
component](?path=/docs/components-status-feedback-label--story-010-neutral) is a better choice.

To display text as content, use the `slot='text'` as an attribute of `b2b-icon` as you can see in this example:

<Canvas columns={3} withSource="open" withToolbar={false}>
  <Story id="components-assets-rounded-icon--story-020-text" />
</Canvas>

## Properties

For both color properties, you can use any type including hex, rgb or css custom properties as long as
you pass it as a string. For example:

```html
<b2b-rounded-icon color="var(--b2b-color-success-50)"></b2b-rounded-icon>
<b2b-rounded-icon color="black"></b2b-rounded-icon>
<b2b-rounded-icon color="#d6e0cc"></b2b-rounded-icon>
```

### color

The color of the circle around the icon or text.

### content-color

The color of the text or icon within the circle.
