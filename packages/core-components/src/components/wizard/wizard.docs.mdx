# Wizard and Wizard-Step Components

The Wizard component will provide an element that will let you set the current step while navigating.
The `b2b-wizard` can wrap up to 6 `b2b-wizard-step` components.

<Canvas columns={3} withSource="open" withToolbar={false}>
  <Story id="components-status-feedback-wizard--story-010-wizard" />
</Canvas>

## Wizard Properties

<br />

### activeStep

Sets the current active step. This will automatically render completed and pending styles for each step. But this can
also be handled directly by the consumer. See the `custom` property for more details.

Use `active-step='0'` to show all steps completed. If using any number higher than the total amount of steps you
will see an error log in the console.

### checkIcon

Defaults to true. It will show a checkmark icon when a step is completed.
If set to false, it will show the step number.

<Story id="components-status-feedback-wizard-icon--story-010-completed" />

### custom

The Wizard provides two modes: `default` and `custom`.

In default mode the wizard will handle steps states automatically, you just need to tell it what is the current
active step:

<Source
  language="tsx"
  format={false}
  code={dedent`
    <b2b-wizard active-step='2'>
      <b2b-wizard-step label='This is step 1'></b2b-wizard-step>
      <b2b-wizard-step label='This is step 2'></b2b-wizard-step>
      <b2b-wizard-step label='This is step 2'></b2b-wizard-step>
    </b2b-wizard>
  `}
/>

For custom mode, you can handle the steps state. This can be used for advance state handling. For example, when
pending steps should have a different style than the default, or specific disable or error states in the future.
Keep in mind that for `custom` mode, the `active-step` property has no effect. Also you will have to provide the
`step` number as well.

<Source
  language="tsx"
  format={false}
  code={dedent`
    <b2b-wizard custom>
      <b2b-wizard-step state='completed' step='1' label='This is step 1'></b2b-wizard-step>
      <b2b-wizard-step state='pending' step='2' label='This is step 2'></b2b-wizard-step>
      <b2b-wizard-step state='disabled' step='3' label='This is step 2'></b2b-wizard-step>
    </b2b-wizard>
  `}
/>

<br />

## Wizard-Step Properties

<br />

### label

The text that will display for each step. Note that the `b2b-wizard-step` does not provide any slots. Use only the
label prop to pass text and not as children.

### step

The step number. For the default Wizard, this prop is automatically set by the parent of the steps. When using
Wizard `custom` mode, it needs to be set from the `b2b-wizard-step`

### checkIcon

Defaults to true. It will show a checkmark icon when a step is completed.
If set to false, it will show the step number. This property can be set directly from the `b2b-wizard` even when
using `custom` mode.

<Story id="components-status-feedback-wizard-icon--story-010-completed" />

### state

For the default Wizard, this prop is automatically set by the parent of the steps. When using Wizard `custom` mode,
it needs to be set from the `b2b-wizard-step`. We support the following states:

<Canvas columns={3} withSource="open" withToolbar={false}>
  <Story id="components-status-feedback-wizard--story-020-wizard-states" />
</Canvas>
