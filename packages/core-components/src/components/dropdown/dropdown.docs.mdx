# Dropdown Component

<Canvas columns={3} withSource="open" withToolbar={false}>
  <Story id="components-form-dropdown--story-010-default" />
</Canvas>

This is a select element that contains a list from which one item can be chosen at a time.
Each option is a native HTML option element that will emit the specified value when chosen.
It is possible to disable individual options. When giving one option the selected attribute, it will be
shown as a placeholder on page load. If none of the options has a selected attribute, by default the
last option will be shown as a placeholder.

## Properties

###Label

The dropdown label. It indicates what the options relate to. This field is recommended, but not required as it can
be ignored in some use cases. For example, when the solution needs a label with a description block of text after it.

Internally the component sets the aria property `aria-labelledby` to the `name` prop of this component. When using a
custom label, remember to set that same name to the `id` of the label. For more information you can see [this link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-labelledby).

###Required

Adds an asterisk at the end of the label to signify that the field is required. This would not perform any
validation, is just a style addition.

###Name

The dropdown name that connects the select element to the label. This is important for accessibility.

###Disabled

Whether or not the dropdown is disabled as a whole. Per default it is false. If it is set to true, the
arrow icon disappears and no interaction is possible.

###Invalid

Whether or not the dropdown is invalid. Setting this to true will render the dropdown with error styles and
show an error message if it is specified. If disabled and invalid are true at the same time, the dropdown
will be rendered as disabled.

###Hint

A hint that can contain additional information for the user. It is optional.

###Error

An error message that is shown if the dropdown is set to invalid. It will not show if the dropdown is
invalid and disabled at the same time. It is optional.

## Events

The dropdown emits events similar to the radio group.

###b2b-change

This event emits the value of the chosen option each time an option element is selected either via
mouse or via keyboard.

###b2b-focus

This event emits a focus event whenever the dropdown is focused.

###b2b-blur

This event emits a focus event whenever the dropdown loses focus.

### Form Elements width

You can change the width of our form elements by directly applying the desired width to the component. Follow
