# Input List Component

_click the component and type to display the list_

<Canvas of={InputListStories.InputList} />

This component will receive a list of options to be presented to the user. It is not a dropdown, and it should be
used as part of a search or filter component, or in any other use case where a list of results makes sense.

<br />

## Properties

### label, placeholder

Will be passed down as an input label and placeholder.

<Source
  language="tsx"
  format={false}
  code={dedent`
    <b2b-input-list placeholder="search here"></b2b-input-list>
  `}
/>

### optionsList

Use to present a list of suggestions to the user. It is currently limited to cursor navigation, but later we will implement keyboard navigation as well.

<Source
  language="tsx"
  format={false}
  code={dedent`
    <b2b-input-list optionsList={myOptionsList}></b2b-input-list>
  `}
/>

### disabled

A boolean to indicate if the element is `disabled`. The default value is `false`.

<br />

## Events

The input list is a wrapper of the `b2b-input` component, so the events from the input component will be emitted as
well. You can find this documentation in this [link](?path=/docs/components-form-input--story-010-default#events).

### b2b-option-selected

This event will emit when the user clicks on an option from the list, if optionsList was provided.

<Source
  language="tsx"
  format={false}
  code={dedent`
  const onOptionSelected = event => {
    const selectedOption = event.detail.selectedOption;
  };
  return (
    <B2bInputList onB2b-option-selected={onOptionSelected} />
  )
  `}
/>

### b2b-clear

This event will emit when the clear `X` button is triggered either by mouse or keyboard interaction.

<Source
  language="tsx"
  format={false}
  code={dedent`
  return (
    <B2bInputList onB2b-clear={clearInput} />
  )
  `}
/>

☝️ When the clear `X` button is triggered, an [Input Event](/docs/components-form-input--story-010-default#b2binput) will also be emitted with the `target.value` empty. So
you can also subscribe to this event and check for an empty value.

<br />

### Custom Lists

You can also provide your HTML for the list instead of an array of options. This allows you to display nested or individually styled lists.
To do so, you can simply nest your custom list HTML in the input list component. **_Please do not supply an `optionsList` in this case. Additionally, keyboard navigation and option selection must be implemented
by you as a consumer, because the component has no knowledge about the slotted list content it displays._**

<Source
  language="html"
  format={false}
  code={dedent`
    <b2b-input-list>
      <ul>
        <li>Option 1</li>
        <li>Option 2</li>
        <li>
          Option 3
          <ul>
            <li>Option 3.1</li>
            <li>Option 3.2</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
    </b2b-input-list>
  `}
/>

### Form Elements Width

You can change the width of our form elements by directly applying the desired width to the component. Follow
this [quick guideline](?path=/story/guidelines-form-usage--page#form-elements-width) if you want to know more.
