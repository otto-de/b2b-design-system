# Multiselect Dropdown Component

<Canvas of={MultiSelectStories.Default} />

## Properties

### Label

The dropdown label shown at the top of the dropdown. Must be a string.

### SelectAllLabel

The label for the select all checkbox at the top of the option list.
Must be a string.

### Placeholder

The placeholder displayed when no option is selected. Must be a string.

### SearchPlaceholder

The placeholder for the search input. Must be a string.

### OptionsList

The list of items displayed as options in the multiselect. Must be a list of strings or string in this format '["apple", "banana"]' or a list of options in this format '[\{ label: "Apple"; value: "apple" \}, \{ label: "Banana"; value: "banana"\}]'.
Complex props (such as objects) must be passed as JavaScript properties, not as HTML attributes.

### SelectedValues

The initial values to be selected in the dropdown. Must be a list of strings or a string in this format '["apple", "banana"]' or a list of options in this format '[\{ label: "Apple"; value: "apple" \}, \{ label: "Banana"; value: "banana"\}]'.

### MaxOptionsVisible

The number of chips visible by default. It is per default set to 8, but can be adjusted
according to the typical length of a chip as well as the available width of the multiselect
container element. If more than the default number of chips displayed are selected, an
additional small chip is displayed that indicates more options are selected.

The chips will wrap to up to three lines before
they exceed the maximum container width. We recommend setting the maximum number so that
3 lines of chips are not exceeded.

## Events

### b2b-selected

This event fires whenever a dropdown option is selected or deselected and
contains all currently selected options as an array of strings.

### b2b-option-selected

Fires whenever a single value is selected or deselected. You can listen to this if you need granular access to options.

```ts
