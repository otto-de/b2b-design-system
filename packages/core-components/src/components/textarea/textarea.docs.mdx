# Textarea Component

<Canvas columns={3} withSource="open" withToolbar={false}>
  <Story id="components-form-textarea--story-060-all-args" />
</Canvas>

## Attributes

### Label

This field is recommended, but not required as it can be ignored in some use cases. For example, when the solution
needs a label with a description block of text after it.

Internally the component sets the aria property `aria-labelledby` to the `name` prop of this component. When using a
custom label, remember to set that same name to the `id` of the label. For more information you can see [this link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-labelledby).

### Placeholder

You can specify a `placeholder` string to be shown before the user enters the textarea element and starts typing.
It is not specified by default.

### Disabled

A boolean indicating whether or not the textarea element is `disabled` or `read-only`. The default value is `false`.

### Hint

An optional hint to be shown underneath the textarea field. It is not specified by default and will therefore not be rendered.
If there is an `error`, the hint will not be rendered until the `error` attribute is set to `undefined` or an
empty string again.

### Error

An optional error string to be shown underneath the textarea field. If specified, it will render the textarea
field with error styles and replace the `hint` text.

Per default, it is undefined and will take the error message as a string as an argument. Once the user
corrects their textarea, you can set it to undefined or to an empty string again.

### Autofocus

A `boolean` indicating whether or not the textarea element should be focused on page load.
Per default it is set to `false`.

### Resize

This attribute determines whether the user can resize the textarea by dragging the lower right hand corner. Per default, it is not
specified and allows resizing both vertically and horizontally. Setting it to `none` disables resizing, `unset` will reset it to an
inherited property and `vertical` or `horizontal` allow resizing in one direction only.

## Name

The name of the form field. Use this when the textarea is used in a native form field. When a `FormData` object is created and the `value`
is appended, the `name` property should be included.

## Max Length

The maximum length of the textarea input. Use this to limit user input.

## Events

The textarea component supports several different events that emit their respective native counterparts (e.g. a b2bFocus event will emit a FocusEvent).
**Per default, we recommend to use the b2bBlur event for validation.**
To see the Event Emitters in action and for usage examples in Vue and React, please refer to [our example repository](https://github.com/otto-ec/b2b-design-system/tree/beta/examples).

### b2bInput

Emits whenever the input is changed, i.e. after every keypress. It will emit all changes to the input,
which enables granular input validation and will immediately update the error state.

### b2bFocus

Emits whenever the textarea element has focus.

### b2bBlur

Emits whenever the textarea element loses focus. Use this event to validate input only after
the user leaves the textarea field. **This is the recommended event to hook into when doing input validation as it
prevents layout shifts. Unless you have a good use case for character-by-character validation, please use this event.**
