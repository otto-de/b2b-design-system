# Separator

The separator component is used for the horizontal or vertical delimitation of content elements.

<Canvas columns={3} withSource="open" withToolbar={false}>
  <Story id="components-utilities-separator--story-010-horizontal" />
</Canvas>

## Properties

<br />

### Alignment

**_Horizontal_** per default, the separator is horizontally aligned. It takes up the full width of it's parent element
and is a block element.

**_Vertical_** for vertically placed content, for example multiple paragraphs next to one another, the separator
can be vertically aligned. It will take up the full height of it's parent element. It is recommended
to use it with `display: flex;` on the parent as well, otherwise other block-level elements like paragraphs
will not align correctly due to their nature.
