# Spinner

The spinner is a circular loading indicator that indicates that page content is being loaded.

## Properties

<Canvas columns={3} withSource="open" withToolbar={false}>
  <Story id="components-status-feedback-spinner--story-010-default" />
</Canvas>

### Color

There are different colors that can be used depending on what background the spinner is placed. While the default variant
is best used on a white background, the inverted variant should be placed on darker backgrounds. The secondary option
is showing a stronger color and therefore can be used both in light and dark contexts.

### Size

The spinner comes in three different sizes that can be adjusted according to the context it is used in.
The size 50 represents a spinner of size 20 x 20px. Size 100, which is the default, is of size 36 x 36px. The largest
size 200 represents a size of 60 x 60px.
