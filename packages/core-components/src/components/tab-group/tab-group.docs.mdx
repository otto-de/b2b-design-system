The B2B Tab Group is used to display multiple tab and tab-panel elements together.
They are linked by their position in the tab group, so make sure every tab's respective
panel is located as it's next sibling.

Any content can be placed inside a tab-panel, but we recommend wrapping the content
with an element of specified height to prevent layout shifts during tab changes.

## Properties

### useRouter

This is a boolean and indicates if the tab group should use internal navigation or not.
It is false per default, meaning the tab group will allow navigation by clicking the tabs or
pressing left and right arrow keys. If you want to use your own route-based navigation, e.g. for
implementing guards or creating a history stack, set `use-router` to `true`.

## Events

### b2b-selected

Emits whenever a new tab is selected.

```typescript
export interface TabChangeEventDetail {
  previousTab: HTMLB2bTabElement;
  nextTab: HTMLB2bTabElement;
}
```

# Tab

## Tab - Properties

### Disabled

Individual tabs can be disabled by setting their `disabled` property to `true`.
Disabled tabs cannot be navigated to and their associated content will not be shown.

### Invalid

Individual tabs can be set to `invalid` if they should be rendered with error styles.

### Selected

Set `selected` to true to determine which tab should be open and have focus on component load. Also, it can be used to
programmatically set the selected tab when `useRouter` is set to true.
