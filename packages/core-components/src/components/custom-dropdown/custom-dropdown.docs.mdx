# Custom Dropdown Component

<Canvas of={CustomDropdownStories.Default} />

The B2B custom dropdown component is interactive and lists down the multiple options. You can hook into an event
that fires whenever the user selects an option from the custom dropdown component.

A trigger component is added to display the B2B custom dropdown component. When the trigger is clicked, the dropdown is
displayed with the options listed below it. Any component can be used as a trigger when it has the `slot='trigger'` attribute.

The options can be selected by clicking on them. Then options need to have the `slot='option'` attribute as mentioned in the above example.

## Properties

### Dropshadow

The custom dropdown component can display a dropshadow when this option is set to true. The default value is false.

### Alignment

The `alignment` property controls the horizontal alignment of the dropdown relative to its trigger.
Accepted values are `left`, `center`, and `right`. The default value is `left`.

### Separator

The options of custom dropdown component can have a separator on enabling it as true which separates the options. The default value is false.

### Icons

Icons can be added to the options of the custom dropdown component and they are displayed on the right side of the option text, when the option is hovered or selected. The icon must be a valid B2B icon name.
You can add an icon to an option by using the `hoveredIcon` and `selectedIcon` attributes to set icons for an optionâ€™s hovered and selected states respectively. When no icon is set, the option will not display any icon.
The colors of the icons can be determined by the `hoveredIconColor` and `selectedIconColor` attributes. The default color for both icons is `b2b-color-black-100`.

### Disabled

The custom dropdown can be disabled, and it would render opaque and unclickable.

/>
