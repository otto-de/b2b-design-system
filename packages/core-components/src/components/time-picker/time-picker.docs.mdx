# TimePicker Component

The time picker allows the user to select a time, either by typing it in or by selecting it from a list of options.
If user types in a time, it has to be in the format "hh:mm". The time picker will perform validation on the input.

It is possible to set the interval of the options in minutes. The default is 15 minutes.

## Properties

### Label

The label for the time picker input field.

### Placeholder

The placeholder for the time picker input field. Default is 'hh:mm'.

### Required

Adds an asterisk at the end of the label to signify that the field is required. This would not perform any
validation and is just a style addition.

### Hint

### Invalid
