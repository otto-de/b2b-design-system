# Button Component

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Primary} sourceState="shown" />

NOTE: All attributes are optional. The component can simply be used like this without specifying any attributes:

<Source code={`<b2b-button>My Button</b2b-button>`} />

## Properties

### Variant

The button pattern is available in two variants:

#### Secondary - default variant

The Secondary button can be used for isolated actions, such as "Edit" or "Export". This is the default variant if
attributes are not specified.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Secondary} />

#### Primary

The Primary button is used for important primary actions, e.g. "Save", "Create new briefing" or "Create new service".

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Primary} />

### Loading

You can use a loading state to show to the user that the action is processing. When set to true, the button label
will be replaced by a loading indicator. If the button is disabled while loading is set to true, it will
render the button as disabled only, i.e. the disabled state will always take precedence over the loading state.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Loading} />

### Disabled

The button can be disabled and it would render opaque and unclickable. <strong>Please note that as a design decision,
both primary and secondary buttons will use the color grey when disabled. </strong>

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Disabled} />

### Href

This property specifies if the button should contain a clickable link. By default, it is undefined, which renders the button
as a HTMLButton element. If a string is specified, the button will be rendered as a HTMLAnchorElement that has the exact look and feel
as the button.

### Target

If the `href` property is specified, `target` defines whether the link should be opened in the same or in a different tab. By default, it will
open in the same tab.

### Download

If the `href` property is specified, defining this string will cause the browser to download the specified URL instead of navigating to it. By
defining `download`, the default name of the downloadable file will be changed to the specified string.

## Icons

In order to emphasize particularly important primary actions, a suitable icon should be used in addition to the text.
For example, a plus icon for "Create new service".

The button can contain the [b2b-icon-100 component](?path=/docs/components-assets-icon--story-010-primary). If an
icon is not yet available, the PaLi font icons can be used as well.

For this you should specify your icon in a reserved `named slot`, depending on if you want the icon at the beginning or at
the end of the button. Please check the following code examples to see how to use slot names.

Note: When using the b2b-icon-100, specify the color attribute as `inherit`; this will allow the icon
to maintain the colors specified by the button slot in its different states, like disabled.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.IconStart} />
<Canvas of={ButtonStories.IconEnd} />
<Canvas of={ButtonStories.PaliIcon} />

Only the secondary button should be used as a pure icon button. For this you can use the icon as normal content
without using the slot space.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.IconOnly} />

### Width

#### Fit-content - default

A button will grow to fit it's text or icon content by default.
If there is not enough space, the button content will wrap, which should be avoided.

#### Fit-container

If the button has a parent container with a specified width, the button will grow to the width of the container.
This can be useful for form layouts where all elements should have the same width.

#### Custom

If the button width is set to custom, the button host element's (`b2b-button`) width can be styled directly like so:

```html
<b2b-button style="width: 200px"> Hello B2B Design System </b2b-button>
```

or by applying a CSS class to the button host element.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.CustomWidth} />
