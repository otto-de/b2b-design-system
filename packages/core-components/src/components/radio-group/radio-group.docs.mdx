## Properties

### Label

The label for the whole radio group. It indicates what the options relate to. This field is recommended, but not required as it can
be ignored in some use cases. For example, when the solution needs a label with a description block of text after it.

Internally the component sets the aria property `aria-labelledby` to the `name` prop of this component. When using a
custom label, remember to set that same name to the `id` of the label. For more information you can see [this link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-labelledby).

### Required

Adds an asterisk at the end of the label to signify that the field is required. This would not perform any
validation, is just a style addition.

### Name

The name of the radio group. This is required to group all child radio buttons together and manage their state.

### Disabled

Whether or not the radio group as a whole is disabled. If not specified, it is set to false.
If both `disabled` and `invalid` properties are set to true, `disabled` will take precedence and no
error will be shown or error styles rendered.

### Invalid

Whether or not the radio group is rendered with error styles. Setting this will also render an
error text if it is specified. The `disabled` property takes precedence over `invalid` regarding styling.

### Hint

A hint text that refers to all radio buttons in the radio group.
Using radio button components in a group will set all individual hint texts to be undefined.

### Error

An error text for the radio group. It will be rendered instead of the hint text if it is specified.
If no error text is specified, but the radio group is set to `invalid`, the hint text will
not appear. The string will be set to undefined for the individual radio button component if it is used in a group.

## Events

### b2b-group-change

Fires whenever the `checked` property of one of its radio children is changed.
Emits a custom event called `RadioEventDetail` that contains the value of the currently active radio button.
as well as it's current status.

`RadioEventDetail<T = any> {
  value: T;
  checked: boolean;
}`
